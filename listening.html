                                Laura and Paul went to a shopping mall. Laura wanted to buy a shirt, but it was too short. On their way home, they saw a small lost dog. They remembered their parents taught them to always help animals, so they stopped. The dog was coughing, so they gave it some water. They also bought some dog food to feed it. The dog was very happy and was hitting the ground with its paws, making funny sounds. Laura and Paul thought that the dog was very cute, and bonded with it right away. In the end, they decided to take it home and keep it as a pet.

He was so happy when he stepped on the solid ground but didn't wait around before heading home to see his family. When he reached his home, Joe shouted out to his son, Milhouse. The boy ran out of the house and threw his arms around his father's shoulders. They entered the house and Milhouse started opening the presents his father had brought him. It was Milhouse's best birthday ever.

The trap made him very mad. Finally, he managed to break it, but he hurt his ankle. Still, he was very happy to know that all the wild cats, rabbits, and other animals will be safe.

                                Aidan was a member of the royal family, but he was not spoiled. He had the latest iPhone but never showed off. Aidan was annoyed by the city noise so he decided to escape to his house on the lake for a short vacation. His childhood friend, Maya, came along because she too enjoyed the great outdoors. They baked a potato pie and drank wine. Maya had a wonderful voice and Aidan played the guitar, so they played and sang all day long. Once it was time for them to go back home, they felt sad but promised to come back soon.
